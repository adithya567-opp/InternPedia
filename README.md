The provided code is a Python script that creates a simple calculator app using the Tkinter library, which is a standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. Here's a brief description of the code:

1. The script starts by importing the necessary modules: tkinter and * from tkinter.
2. It creates a Tkinter root window and sets its properties, such as title, size, and background color.
3. The show function is defined to display the user's input on the calculator's display.
4. The clear function is defined to clear the display.
5. The calculate function is defined to evaluate the user's input expression and display the result.
6. A label is created to display the user's input and the result.
7. Buttons are created for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /, %), and other functions (clear, equals).
8. Each button is configured with a command that calls the appropriate function (show, clear, or calculate) when clicked.
9. The mainloop function is called to start the Tkinter event loop and display the calculator window.
